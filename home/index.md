Stretching from the shores of Turkey to the Ionian Sea east of Italy, the **Greek islands** have been the crossroads of the Mediterranean since the time of Homer and boast some of the most intriguing food in the world.

Simple but never plain, the cooking of the islands relies on flavourful ingredients rather than complicated techniques, making extensive use of seasonal vegetables, fresh herbs, grains and beans, olives and olive oil, cheeses and fish.

Inflected with subtle Italian and Eastern accents, the cuisine is at once straightforward and sophisticated.

As one would expect from an archipelago, fresh fish and seafood are plentiful. Fishermen supply tavernas directly, often docking right outside and handing over the catch to the chef. In the interior of the islands, fish is less common but not missed, thanks to the abundance of lamb, cheese, and a host of locally grown vegetables that make the tables groan and dinersâ€™ mouths water.
