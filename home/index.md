Stretching from the shores of Turkey to the Ionian Sea east of Italy, the Greek islands have been the crossroads of the Mediterranean since the time of Homer and boast some of the most intriguing food in the world.

Simple but never plain, the cooking of the islands relies on flavourful ingredients rather than complicated techniques, making extensive use of seasonal vegetables, fresh herbs, grains and beans, olives and olive oil, cheeses and fish.

Inflected with subtle Italian and Eastern accents, the cuisine is at once straightforward and sophisticated.

The strategic position of the Ionian Islands off the west coast of Greece at the base of the Adriatic Sea has brought invaders, traders and culinary traditions from all over the Mediterranean basin. Venetian influences can be found not only in the type of dishes, but also in their names: *stufato*, a rich Ionian stew, has Italian origins, and pasta dishes, such as *pastitsio* - a macaroni, ragú and béchamel dish - are fairly common. Greek food, of course, has much in common with that of its Turkish neighbours, and the long domination of the Ottoman Empire deeply influenced not only the style of cooking but also the very way meals are consumed in Greece. In the Ionian Islands, as on the mainland, dining is all about *meze*, lots of little taster plates to be shared convivially by friends and all the family - Greeks expect children, however young, to accompany their parents.

As one would expect from an archipelago, fresh fish and seafood are plentiful. Fishermen supply tavernas directly, often docking right outside and handing over the catch to the chef. In the interior of the islands, fish is less common but not missed, thanks to the abundance of lamb, cheese, and a host of locally grown vegetables that make the tables groan and diners’ mouths water.
